	abstract = {A fundamental challenge in ecology is to understand the mechanisms that govern patterns of relative species abundance. Previous numerical simulations have suggested that complex niche-structured models produce species abundance distributions (SADs) that are qualitatively similar to those of very simple neutral models that ignore differences between species. However, in the absence of an analytical treatment of niche models, one cannot tell whether the two classes of model produce the same patterns via similar or different mechanisms. We present an analytical proof that, in the limit as diversity becomes large, a strong niche model give rises to exactly the same asymptotic form of SAD as the neutral model, and we verify the analytical predictions for a Panamanian tropical forest data set. Our results strongly suggest that neutral processes drive patterns of relative species abundance in high-diversity ecological communities, even when strong niche structure exists. However, neutral theory cannot explain what generates high diversity in the first place, and it may not be valid in low-diversity communities. Our results also confirm that neutral theory cannot be used to infer an absence of niche structure or to explain ecosystem function.},

There is no consensus over which model is correct, because the degree to which different processes can be discerned from SAD patterns has not yet been rigorously quantified. We present a power calculation to quantify our ability to detect deviations from neutrality using species abundance data. We study non-neutral stochastic community models, and show that the presence of non-neutral processes is detectable if sample size is large enough and/or the amplitude of the effect is strong enough. Our framework can be used for any candidate community model that can be simulated on a computer, and determines both the sampling effort required to distinguish between alternative processes, and a range for the strength of non-neutral processes in communities whose patterns are statistically consistent with neutral theory. We find that even data sets of the scale of the 50 Ha forest plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, are unlikely to be large enough to detect deviations from neutrality caused by competitive interactions alone, though the presence of multiple non-neutral processes with contrasting effects on abundance distributions may be detectable.},

	abstract = {The competitive exclusion principle is one of the most influential concepts in ecology. The classical formulation suggests a correlation between competitor species similarity and competition severity, leading to rapid competitive exclusion where species are very similar; yet neutral models show that identical species can persist in competition for long periods. Here, we resolve the conflict by examining two components of similarity – niche overlap and competitive similarity – and modeling the effects of each on exclusion rate (defined as the inverse of time to exclusion). Studying exclusion rate, rather than the traditional focus on binary outcomes (coexistence versus exclusion), allows us to examine classical niche and neutral perspectives using the same currency. High niche overlap speeds exclusion, but high similarity in competitive ability slows it. These predictions are confirmed by a well-known model of two species competing for two resources. Under ecologically plausible scenarios of correlation between these two factors, the strongest exclusion rates may be among moderately similar species, while very similar and highly dissimilar competitors have very low exclusion rates. Adding even small amounts of demographic stochasticity to the model blurs the line between deterministic and probabilistic coexistence still further. Thus, focusing on exclusion rate, instead of on the binary outcome of coexistence versus exclusion, allows a variety of outcomes to result from competitive interactions. This approach may help explain species coexistence in diverse competitive communities and raises novel issues for future work.},

They can provide considerable insight into the roles of non-species-specific factors (e.g. stochasticity, dispersal, speciation) on community dynamics but often require intensive simulations, particularly in spatial settings. Here, we clearly explain existing techniques for modelling spatially explicit neutral processes in ecology using coalescence. Furthermore, we present several novel extensions to these methods including procedures for dealing with system boundaries which enable improved investigation of the effects of dispersal. We also present a semi-analytical algorithm that calculates the expected species richness in a sample, for any speciation rate. By eliminating the effect of stochasticity in the speciation process, we reduce the variance in estimates of species richness. Our benchmarks show that the combination of existing coalescence theory and our extensions produces higher quality results in vastly shorter time scales than previously possible: years of simulation time are reduced to minutes. As an example application, we find parameters for a spatially explicit neutral model to approximate the species richness of a tropical forest dataset.},

	abstract = {Aim It has been recently suggested that different ‘unified theories of biodiversity and biogeography’ can be characterized by three common ‘minimal sufficient rules’: (1) species abundance distributions follow a hollow curve, (2) species show intraspecific aggregation, and (3) species are independently placed with respect to other species. Here, we translate these qualitative rules into a quantitative framework and assess if these minimal rules are indeed sufficient to predict multiple macroecological biodiversity patterns simultaneously. Location Tropical forest plots in Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, and in Sinharaja, Sri Lanka. Methods We assess the predictive power of the three rules using dynamic and spatial simulation models in combination with census data from the two forest plots. We use two different versions of the model: (1) a neutral model and (2) an extended model that allowed for species differences in dispersal distances. In a first step we derive model parameterizations that correctly represent the three minimal rules (i.e. the model quantitatively matches the observed species abundance distribution and the distribution of intraspecific aggregation). In a second step we applied the parameterized models to predict four additional spatial biodiversity patterns. Results Species-specific dispersal was needed to quantitatively fulfil the three minimal rules. The model with species-specific dispersal correctly predicted the species–area relationship, but failed to predict the distance decay, the relationship between species abundances and aggregations, and the distribution of a spatial co-occurrence index of all abundant species pairs. These results were consistent over the two forest plots. Main conclusions The three ‘minimal sufficient’ rules only provide an incomplete approximation of the stochastic spatial geometry of biodiversity in tropical forests. The assumption of independent interspecific placements is most likely violated in many forests due to shared or distinct habitat preferences. Furthermore, our results highlight missing knowledge about the relationship between species abundances and their aggregation.},

	abstract = {The mass-extinction events caused by human-driven habitat loss are a current concern in conservation science. However, the observed number of extinctions is considerably smaller than predicted. The overestimation of extinction rates comes from the time-delay which depends on the species sensitivity to habitat changes. The standard method of predicting the effect of habitat loss on biodiversity is to use the species–area relationship and progressively following it backwards to smaller areas. The difference between the actual number of species and the one provided by the backwards species–area relationship is dubbed extinction debt. Previous studies in general adopt a static view for the spatial distribution of species. Nonetheless, a precise understanding of the problem urges us to adopt a dynamic framework to this issue since the time between disturbances of the landscape plays an active role in influencing the strength of the extinction debt. In this context, here we address two distinct approaches for this question: a static and a dynamic view of fragmentation. In the former we quantify the extinction debt in a quenched spatial distribution of species, whereas in the latter the community is let to evolve between disturbance events of the landscape. Here we show that the size of the extinction debt depends on the pattern of the fragmentation. It is found that random distributions of destroyed habitats provide larger extinction debts than those obtained for contiguous areas of fragmentation. Furthermore, in the dynamic approach it is observed that dispersal can lead to unexpected outcomes such as lower biodiversity levels than ones inferred from the backwards species–area relationship.},

Aims Review the empirical and theoretical SLOSS literature; identify potential mechanisms underlying the SS > SL pattern; evaluate these where possible. Location Global. Time period 1976–2018. Major taxa Plants, invertebrates, vertebrates. Methods Literature review. Results Like previous reviews, I found that SS > SL dominates empirical findings. This pattern remained, although it was somewhat weakened, in studies where sampling intensity was proportional to patch size. I found six classes of theory, and conducted five preliminary evaluations of theory. None of the predictions was supported. The SS > SL pattern held for specialist species groups, suggesting it does not result from incursion by generalists into small patches. I found no evidence for the prediction that the reverse pattern (SL > SS) becomes more common over time since patch creation, through gradual species losses from SS. I found no difference between results for natural and anthropogenic patches. There was also no evidence for predictions that SL > SS is more common when the matrix is more hostile, or for stable than ephemeral patches. Main conclusions Most empirical comparisons find SS > SL. While there are several potential causes, more empirical work is needed to identify those at play. Meanwhile, conservation practitioners should understand that there is no ecological evidence supporting a general principle to preserve large, contiguous habitat areas rather than multiple small areas of the same total size.},

Nevertheless, biodiversity conservation is hindered because how such commitments should be implemented has been strongly debated, which can lead to suboptimal habitat protection decisions. We argue that, despite the debates, there are three essential principles for area-based biodiversity conservation. These principles are related to habitat geographic coverage, amount, and connectivity. They emerge from evidence that, while large areas of nature are important and must be protected, conservation or restoration of multiple small habitat patches is also critical for global conservation, particularly in regions with high land use. We contend that the many area-based conservation initiatives expected in the coming decades should follow the principles we identify, regardless of ongoing debates. Considering the importance of biodiversity for maintenance of ecosystem services, we suggest that this would bring widespread societal benefits.},

This conclusion may be valid for small spatial scales and when the total amount of habitat is large, but modelling and empirical studies demonstrate adverse demographic consequences of fragmentation when there is little habitat across large areas. Fragmentation effects are best tested with studies on individual species rather than on communities, as the latter typically consist of species with dissimilar habitat requirements. The total amount of habitat and the degree of fragmentation tend to be correlated, which poses another challenge for empirical studies. I conclude that fragmentation poses an extra threat to biodiversity, in addition to the threat posed by loss of habitat area.},

abstract = {Abstract A core aspiration of the ecological sciences is to determine how systems work, which implies the challenge of developing a causal understanding. Causal inference has long been approached from a statistical perspective, which can be limited and restrictive for a variety of reasons. Ecologists and other natural scientists have historically pursued mechanistic knowledge as an alternative approach to causal understanding, though without explicit reference to the requirements of causal statistics. In this paper, I describe the premises of an expanded paradigm for causal studies, the Integrative Causal Investigation Paradigm, that subsumes causal statistics and mechanistic investigation into a multi-evidence approach. This paradigm is distinct from the one articulated by causal statistics in that it (1) focuses its attention on the long-term goal of building causal knowledge across multiple studies and (2) recognizes the essential role of mechanistic investigations in establishing a causal understanding. The Integrative Paradigm, consequentially, proposes that there are multiple methodological routes to building causal knowledge and thus represents a pluralistic perspective. This paper begins by describing the crux of the problem faced by causal statistics. To understand this problem, it should be recognized that the word causal has multiple meanings and a variety of evidential standards. An expanded vocabulary is developed so as to reduce ambiguities and clarify critical issues. I further show by example that there is an important ingredient typically omitted from consideration in causal statistics, which is the known information related to the mechanisms underlying relationships being evaluated. To address this issue, I describe a procedure, Causal Knowledge Analysis, that involves an evaluation and compilation of existing evidence indicative of causal content and the features of mechanisms. Causal Knowledge Analysis is applied to three example situations to illustrate the process and its potential for contributing to the development of causal knowledge. The implications of adopting the proposed paradigm and associated procedures are discussed and include the potential for advancing ecology, the potential for clarifying causal methodology, and the potential for contributing to predictive forecasting.},

abstract = {Abstract When evaluating the impact of a biodiversity conservation intervention, a counterfactual is typically needed. Counterfactuals are possible alternative system trajectories in the absence of an intervention. Comparing observed outcomes against the chosen counterfactual allows the impact (change attributable to the intervention) to be determined. Because counterfactuals by definition never occur, they must be estimated. Sometimes, there may be many plausible counterfactuals, including various drivers of biodiversity change and defined on a range of spatial or temporal scales. Here, we posit that, by definition, conservation interventions always take place in social-ecological systems (SES) (i.e., ecological systems integrated with human actors). Evaluating the impact of an intervention in an SES, therefore, means taking into account the counterfactuals assumed by different human actors. Use of different counterfactuals by different actors will give rise to perceived differences in the impacts of interventions, which may lead to disagreement about its success or the effectiveness of the underlying approach. Despite that there are biophysical biodiversity trends, it is often true that no single counterfactual is definitively the right one for conservation assessment, so multiple evaluations of intervention efficacy could be considered justifiable. Therefore, we propose calculating the sum of perceived differences, which captures the range of impact estimates associated with different actors in a given SES. The sum of perceived differences gives some indication of how closely actors in an SES agree on the impacts of an intervention. We applied the concept of perceived differences to a set of global, national, and regional case studies (e.g., global realization of Aichi Target 11 for marine protected areas, effect of biodiversity offsetting on vegetation condition in Australia, and influence of conservation measures on an endangered ungulate in Central Asia). We explored approaches for minimizing the sum, including a combination of negotiation and structured decision making, careful alignment of expectations on scope and measurement, and explicit recognition of any intractable differences between stakeholders.},

It argues that, in fact, the use of statistical models for causal inference is itself more controversial than it may seem at first. The chapter systematically scrutinizes randomized control trials, instrumental variables, and directed acyclic graphs more specifically with respect to assumptions that cannot be tested in practice because of data availability, assumptions that are untestable in principle because they would require infinite knowledge capabilities, and how reliability is established in practice within these methods. It discusses putative fundamental differences between ABMs and experimental/observational methods.}

    abstract = {The current paradigm for causal inference in epidemiology relies primarily on the evaluation of counterfactual contrasts via statistical regression models informed by graphical causal models (often in the form of directed acyclic graphs, or DAGs) and their underlying mathematical theory. However, there have been growing calls for supplementary methods, and one such method that has been proposed is agent-based modelling due to its potential for simulating counterfactuals. However, within the epidemiological literature, there currently exists a general lack of clarity regarding what exactly agent-based modelling is (and is not) and, importantly, how it differs from microsimulation modelling—perhaps its closest methodological comparator. We clarify this distinction by briefly reviewing the history of each method, which provides a context for their similarities and differences, and casts light on the types of research questions that they have evolved (and thus are well suited) to answering; we do the same for DAG-informed regression methods. The distinct historical evolutions of DAG-informed regression modelling, microsimulation modelling and agent-based modelling have given rise to distinct features of the methods themselves, and provide a foundation for critical comparison. Not only are the three methods well suited to addressing different types of causal questions, but, in doing so, they place differing levels of emphasis on fixed and random effects, and also tend to operate on different timescales and in different timeframes.},

abstract = {Summary Landscape heterogeneity and habitat connectivity affect species movements, playing an important role in determining the likelihood of species persistence. However, landscape connectivity is usually evaluated using static snap-shots, which do not account for the sequential interactions among habitat patches through time. We developed a network-based model of landscape dynamics, and corresponding connectivity metrics, to account for the reachable habitat across space and time. We illustrate the behaviour of these metrics, using fragmented forested landscapes in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. We parametrized the models using the dispersal capacities of selected bird and small mammal species. We found that when considering spatio-temporal links, connectivity is estimated to be on average 30\% higher (with a maximum of 150\% higher) than what is estimated from purely spatial models. This higher degree of spatio-temporal connectivity arises due to connections through temporal stepping-stone patches that appear (habitat gain) and disappear (habitat loss) over time. Species with short dispersal distances (<1000 m) particularly benefited from the spatio-temporal connections. The contribution of spatio-temporal connectivity to habitat reachability increased with higher habitat loss rates. Moreover, it depended on the amount of habitat in the landscape, being higher at intermediate habitat amounts (∼30\%). We showed that accounting for spatio-temporal connectivity is critical for understanding ecological patterns and processes in dynamic landscapes, and that a series of purely spatial connectivity metrics underestimates the actual connectivity patterns across time. The proposed spatio-temporal connectivity approach and metrics can be applied to evaluate the effective connectivity patterns and trends in a variety of dynamic landscapes, avoiding the potential overestimates of population isolation and extinction probabilities that may result from widely used purely spatial connectivity models.},
